# MLClusters

**MLClusters** is a modern fork of [Khiops Enneade](https://github.com/KhiopsML/enneade), a legacy clustering tool originally developed by Orange Labs as part of the Khiops suite.

The original *Enneade* is no longer maintained and was based on an outdated version of the Khiops library (v10.1). MLClusters aims to revitalize and modernize the tool by:

- Keeping up to date with the latest Khiops releases to benefit from new features, performance improvements, and bug fixes  
- Simplifying parameter tuning â€” without sacrificing flexibility â€” for a shorter learning curve  
- Enhancing code robustness, modularity, flexibility, and maintainability  

**MLClusters is currently in active development.**  
A public release is expected in **summer 2025**.
