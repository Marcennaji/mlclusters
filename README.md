# MLClusters

**MLClusters** is a modern fork of [Khiops Enneade](https://github.com/KhiopsML/enneade), a legacy clustering tool originally developed by Orange Labs as part of the Khiops suite.

The original *Enneade* is no longer maintained and was built on an outdated version of the Khiops library (v10.1). MLClusters brings new life to this tool by:

- Staying up to date with the latest Khiops releases to benefit from new features and performance improvements  
- Simplifying parameter tuning — without sacrificing flexibility — for a shorter learning curve  
- Improving code modularity, flexibility, and maintainability  
- Providing a robust suite of unit tests to ensure code reliability  



## 📅 Roadmap
