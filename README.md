# MLClusters 🚀  
**MLClusters** is an open-source machine learning clustering library, designed to enhance KMeans, KNN, and predictive clustering with advanced capabilities.  

## 🔍 About  
MLClusters is a **fork of [Khiops Enneade](https://github.com/KhiopsML/enneade)**, an older clustering tool from the Khiops suite, developed by Orange Labs.  
- The **original Enneade** is no longer maintained by the Khiops team.  
- It was based on an **older version of the Khiops library** (10.1).  

MLClusters aims to **modernize and enhance** Enneade by:  
- **Migrating to the latest Khiops release**, and staying up-to-date with future Khiops releases.  
- **Redesigning a new GUI**.  

## 📅 Roadmap  
- Done: 

     ✅ 07.04.2025 : C++ code, that was based on Khiops 10.1, has been migrated in order to integrate with **Khiops 10.7.0-b.0** (warning: this is a Khiops pre-release version).  

- Upcoming:

    🛠  Design improvements  
    🛠  Unit tests implementation  
    🚀 Public release (TBD).
